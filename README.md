## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Use Python classes to model a `Band` made up of different kinds of musicians.

Start with `Guitarist`,`Bassist`, and `Drummer`.

Make use of a `Musician` base class to handle common functionality which particular kinds of musicians will inherit.

### User Acceptance Tests

Unit tests will be supplied for this lab. Your job is to make them pass. Do NOT modify the supplied tests (except to enable for stretch goals.)
